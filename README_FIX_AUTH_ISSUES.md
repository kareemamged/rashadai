# Fix for Authentication Issues in Supabase

This document explains how to fix the "Database error granting user" issue that occurs during login.

## Problem Description

When users try to log in, they may encounter the following error:

```
Database error granting user 500
```

This error occurs when there is an issue with the Supabase authentication system, specifically when granting roles to users after successful authentication.

## Solution

The solution involves:

1. Creating secure RPC functions that bypass the standard authentication flow
2. Implementing a fallback authentication mechanism
3. Checking for blocked users during login

## Files Included

1. `fix_auth_issues.sql` - SQL script to fix authentication issues

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply the SQL Fixes

Execute the `fix_auth_issues.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_auth_issues.sql`
4. Run the script

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After applying the SQL fixes, you should verify that the issue is resolved:

1. Try to log in with a valid user account
2. Check the browser console for any errors
3. Verify that the login process completes successfully

## Technical Details

### New RPC Functions

The new RPC functions provide a secure way to handle authentication:

- `auth_user_check(email TEXT, password TEXT)` - Checks if a user exists with the given email
- `get_auth_user_by_email(email_param TEXT)` - Gets user information by email
- `check_user_blocked(user_id UUID)` - Checks if a user is blocked
- `validate_user_login(email_param TEXT, password_param TEXT)` - Validates login credentials and checks if the user is blocked

These functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` to run with the privileges of the function creator, bypassing potential permission issues.

### Code Changes

The application code has been updated to use the new RPC functions:

1. `signInWithEmail()` now tries to validate the user using `validate_user_login` first
2. If a user is blocked, the login is rejected with an appropriate error message
3. The fallback authentication mechanism is still in place for cases where the primary authentication fails

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after applying the fix:

1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify that the RPC functions were created successfully in the database
3. Make sure the application code is using the new functions correctly
4. Try clearing your browser cache and local storage

### Common Errors

#### Error: Function does not exist

If you see an error like:

```
ERROR: function validate_user_login(text, text) does not exist
```

This means that the function was not created successfully. Try running the SQL script again and check for any errors during execution.

#### Error: User is blocked

If you see an error like:

```
Error: User is blocked
```

This is actually expected behavior when a blocked user tries to log in. The system is correctly identifying that the user is blocked and preventing login.

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- The fix preserves the ability to store user data in localStorage as a fallback
- The fix improves security by using `SECURITY DEFINER` functions with explicit `search_path` settings
- The fix adds the ability to block users and prevent them from logging in
